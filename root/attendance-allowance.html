		<div class="text-column"><p>Matt and Aaron go online to GOV.UK to find what support he might be able to get. They learn that they can get additional support from Attendance Allowance to help with the cost of self-funding.</p><p>As Aaron struggles to remember things, it would be difficult for him to manage his own claim. Aaron’s son Matt registers to become his appointee, so that he can easily manage his father’s affairs across DWP services.</p>

			  <p>We're making it easier to engage with our services, whether it's online, over the telephone, or you're claiming for someone else as a formal appointee. We're designing an online claim process for Attendance Allowance to be inclusive to as many groups as possible.</p>

			  <p>Our Identity and Trust technology will make it easier for our staff and services to correctly identify citizens. We'll be able to establish the identity of a citizen against pre-defined confidence levels.</p>

			  <p>We're simplifying the claim process for citizens and staff by only asking the absolutely neccessary questions we need to determine their entitlement. We're automating the checks for Residency, Presence and other benefits using the shared components the DWP is building for each of these tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention.</p>

			  <p>We'll automate the simplest case decisions, which will free up colleagues to handle cases with more complex needs. We'll present information to decision makers in a user friendly format, making it easier for them to review claims and deliver a faster decision. We'll improve the agent interface for telephone claims to make it more efficient.</p>

			  <p>If circumstances change, Matt can easily report it himself, however things don't always go to plan. Sometimes people forget to tell us about changes which can have a serious impact on their claim. If Aaron's care starts to be paid by the Local Authority, we can find out ourselves, and we'll update the claim appropriately. Responding quickly to change reduces the risk of overpaying vulnerable citizens.</p>
