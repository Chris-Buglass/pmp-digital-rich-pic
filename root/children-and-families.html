			  <p>We're replacing the old paper-based process with our digital service as well as making it easier to navigate the Child Maintenance journey online for citizens. Guiding more citizens to our digital services will help to reduce the demand on our telephony lines, and free up skilled agents to help those with more complex needs.</p>

			  <p>We know from experience that some citizens who engage with the Child Maintenance Service may have experienced domestic abuse. We're expanding the online support and guidance we offer to victims. We're also offering more self-help features to aid and inform citizens about their claim, and responsibilities.</p>
